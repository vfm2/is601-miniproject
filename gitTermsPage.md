#### Checkout

**Definition:** Checkout is used for preparing to work on a specific branch. You often use _git checkout_ when you want to
work on some code that isn't on the main branch. You can use this command to switch to an already existing branch
or even make a new branch, then switch to that branch to work on.

**Example:**
```shell
git checkout foo 
#This command switches to already-exiting branch named foo.

git checkout -b notMain
#This command makes a new branch named notMain and switches to it.
```
