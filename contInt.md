# Continuous Integration

### What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration is the practice of merging multiple developers' code into one project automatically.
In a single repository that several developers are working on, changes that are made to the code by different people can
automatically be merged. As with something like Git where typing out commits and pushes and pulls are manual, continuous integration may
provide a quicker way to merge everyone's code together.

### How can Continuous Integration improve productivity and competitiveness?
One of the advantages of Continuous Integration is that since it's automated, the process is able to prevent 
any developer's work from diverting from the main repository too much. 
The main repository's code is always dependable and everyone is able to access all of those changes early on.
This means that if, for example, a team of developers are working on an app or website and they come across some bugs, they are able to detect those bugs early.
Bugs often hide other bugs and being able to catch any mistakes and ensure all code is working on each person's end will save time and money.
