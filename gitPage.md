## The Importance of GIT for Productivity in Companies 

#### GIT who? 

Git is a source control system to help teams collaborate in a single project without disturbing any other code. GIT tracks changes created locally, and when the developer is ready for those changes to be pushed, GIT will add those changes to your repository. Want to find out more about terms and definitions?

#### But how can GIT improve productivity?

Git improves productivity by allowing multiple developers to work on multiple features all at once. Users can review code done by each member and track each others work.
