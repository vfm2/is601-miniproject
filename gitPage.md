# Let's GIT it
## The Importance of GIT for Productivity in Companies 

#### What is GIT? 

Git is a source control system to help teams collaborate in a single project without disturbing any other code. GIT tracks changes created locally, and when the developer is ready for those changes to be pushed, GIT will add those changes to your repository. Want to find out more about terms and definitions?

#### How can GIT improve productivity and competitiveness?

Git improves productivity by allowing multiple developers to work on multiple features all at once. Users can review code done by each member and track each other's work.

Git has the following features:

- Branching and Merging
    - Git encourage multiple branches of a repository to independent versions of code. Developers can switch branches easily then merge them into a single master branch.
- Small and Fast
    - By having GIT operations performed locally, the average speed of GIT compared the competitor SVN can be up to 138 times faster.
- Distributed
    - Teams can have full backups of the same repository distributed between multiple developers in their local directories. 
- Data Assurance
    - Git ensures every file/commit is checksummed and all history is tracked. 
- Staging Area
    - The staging area in git allows the developer to save their changes before committing them to the repository. Developers can review their changes prior to committing. 
- Free and Open Source
    - Git can be used by anyone! It is a free software.
- Trademark
    - Information on the Git Tradmark Policy can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/about/trademark)

All of these features make GIT the perfect management tool to use for small or large projects. To learn more about GIT, please go to the [GIT website.](https://git-scm.com/about "GIT About Page")
