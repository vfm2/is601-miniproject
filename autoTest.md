# Automated Testing

### What is Automated Testing?
Automatic testing is a way to automate those small but necessary tasks when creating a page, program, or whatever it is you're working on! It's like adding a bit of a middle man to the process. You can also use Test Automation for any additional testing on your code that may be difficult or tedious to do manually.
For a test to be automated, it must be repeatable, determinant, and unopinionated. This means the test is able to be repeated, able to output the same result for the same input, and not have any opinions (duh).

Here are some examples of Automated Testing! These are just a few types, as there are many more out there.
* API Testing
* Continuous Testing
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) Testing
* Code Analysis

### How can Automated Testing improve productivity and competitiveness of a company?
Automated testing can help speed up the process of programming. As opposed to running any tests or completing all your small tasks manually, you can spend more time on those more complex parts of your project. With automated testing, you can save time you would otherwise spend doing repetitive and easy tasks. This will make work faster and more efficient.

Additionally, say you're a developer for a mobile game. You're still working out some kinks for an early version of the app and want to test out some features. With automated testing, you're able to test out any updates or changes to the game without much struggle.
The faster you push out new updates, the more appealing and even better the app will be to the public. This can prove you to be a good competitor in the mobile game market!
