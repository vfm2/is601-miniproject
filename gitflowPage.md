# The Gitflow Method


### What is Gitflow? 
Gitflow is a workflow branch model created by Vincent Driessen about 10 years ago. 
It is meant to help developers better collaborate on projects together using the same Git repositories and branches.

### Why Should You Git With the Flow?
Gitflow has several benefits.
* Parallel Development
  * In a team of developers, the work is divided up however they see fit.
    The Gitflow model uses something called **feature branches** which is where individual tasks are completed by individual coders
    before being integrated back into the main repository.
* Collaboration
  * Evidently, collaboration and parallel development go hand in hand. To add on to the previous point, 
    what's great about the Gitflow method is that everyone can work on the project simultaneously.
    Everyone can also see what everyone else is doing in the project.
* Release Staging Area
  * When new things are developed, they get merged into the **develop branch** which is an area
    where stuff from the feature branches stay before being checked into being good to go into the main repository.
    It's like a double check to ensure all code works well before being merged into the main branch.
* Support for Emergency Fixes
    * Finally, Gitflow has **hotfix branches** which is a place for developers to fix any bugs that suddenly come up
    when running their program.
